# Tensorflow on Kubeflow on Azure Stack

This module demonstrates how to run TensorFlow jobs on Kubeflow cluster on Azure Stack.

[TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) is a popular open source machine learning framework.
It was initially developed by the Google Brain team for internal Google use, and later released under
the Apache License 2.0.

# Prerequisites

Previous familiarity with the following is recommended:

- [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [TensorFlow](https://tensorflow.org/)
- [Azure](http://azure.com)
- [Kubeflow](https://github.com/kubeflow/kubeflow)

For obvious reasons, distributed training of the models is easier to see if the cluster has more than one node in its pool, and, respectively, at least that amount of the replicas for the worker conterner instances.

# Installation

Please see the `Kubeflow on Azure Stack` module of this repository, or [https://www.kubeflow.org](https://www.kubeflow.org) for details of using Kubeflow and installing it on Azure or Azure Stack.

`TFJob` is a custom workload, and you should see it among the registered custom resources:

    azureuser@k8s-master-36519982-0:~$ kubectl get crd | grep tfjob
    tfjobs.kubeflow.org          2020-05-06T01:30:30Z

It is also recommended, but not necessary, to have Kubernetes Dashboard running on the cluster.


# Building Docker image for distributed mnist model for e2e test

We will run a popular scenario from Kubeflow's repository, 
[K8s Custom Resource and Operator For TensorFlow jobs](https://github.com/kubeflow/tf-operator/)

You do not have to re-build the image, you can use `kubeflow/tf-dist-mnist-test:1.0`. If you do decide to use your own image, here is how you could build it:

    $ cd tensorflow-on-kubeflow/dist-mnist-e2e-test

Login to your Docker account:

    $ docker login
    ... enter the credentials if needed ...

Build the image:

    $ docker build -f Dockerfile -t rollingstones/tf-dist-mnist-test:1.0 ./
    Sending build context to Docker daemon  18.94kB
    Step 1/3 : FROM tensorflow/tensorflow:1.5.0

And to push to DockerHub or another container registry or artifactory:

    $ docker push rollingstones/tf-dist-mnist-test:1.0
    The push refers to repository [docker.io/rollingstones/tf-dist-mnist-test]

# Running a TFJob

Create a tf_job_mnist-e2e-test.yaml file:

    apiVersion: "kubeflow.org/v1"
    kind: "TFJob"
    metadata:
      name: "dist-mnist-for-e2e-test-demo"
    spec:
      tfReplicaSpecs:
        PS:
          replicas: 1
          restartPolicy: OnFailure
          template:
            spec:
              containers:
                - name: tensorflow
                  image: rollingstones/tf-dist-mnist-test:1.0
        Worker:
          replicas: 3
          restartPolicy: OnFailure
          template:
            spec:
            containers:
              - name: tensorflow
                image: rollingstones/tf-dist-mnist-test:1.0

To run a TFJob:

    $ kubectl create -f tf_job_mnist-e2e-test.yaml

You should see the pods being initialized, then running, and, finally, getting to status `Completed`:

    $ kubeclt get pods
    NAME                                    READY   STATUS             RESTARTS   AGE
    dist-mnist-for-e2e-test-demo-worker-0     0/1     Completed          0          9m21s
    dist-mnist-for-e2e-test-demo-worker-1     0/1     Completed          0          9m21s
    dist-mnist-for-e2e-test-demo-worker-2     0/1     Completed          0          9m21s

Here is an example of the log on a worker node:

    $ kubectl logs dist-mnist-for-e2e-test-demo-worker-0

What is worth pointing out is that the nodes are being assigned individual indices:
