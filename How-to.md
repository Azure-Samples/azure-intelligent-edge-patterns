Building Your First VisionOnEdge (VoE) Model
============================================

Building Machine Learning (ML) models and bringing them into production is often difficult, depending on complicated platforms and expensive expertise. VisionOnEdge (VoE) simplifies this process by integrating devices and models in a no-code environment. To see this for yourself, let's build your first model together.

Setup
-----

[This][sim] is an instance of VoE deployed on Azure VM that you can use throughout this assignment for testing and experimentation, etc. We have already added a simulated camera and a couple of models to simplify the journey for you.
