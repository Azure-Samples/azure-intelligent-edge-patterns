# Vision on Edge Solution

This is a solution showing how to deploy a Custom Vision model to Azure IoT edge device and get Machine learning solution up and running in a single day.
You can define your location, camera and set up objects to detect example: any manufacturing parts, defected parts, etc. while keeping your video footage private, lowering your badnwidth costs and even running everything offline. We use onnxruntime to acclerate your models on edge device using Open Vino for CPU and TensorRT for Nvidia GPU and Arm64 GPU. This solution is capable of processing multiple cameras with Microsoft AVA and OpenCV.

# Prerequisites

## Hardware

You need to have one of the following:

- **Azure Stack Edge**: A portfolio of devices that bring the compute, storage and intelligence to the edge right where data is created. Find out more [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/azure-stack/edge/)
  - Please ensure that you have compute configured and you can run [GPU getting started module here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databox-online/azure-stack-edge-gpu-deploy-sample-module-marketplace)
- **Azure Stack HCI**: A hyperconverged infrastructure (HCI) cluster solution that hosts virtualized Windows and Linux workloads and their storage in a hybrid, on-premises environment. Find out more [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure-stack/hci/overview). You can either:
  - Create a linux VM in your HCI environment by following [this](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure-stack/hci/manage/vm) and then follow this to [install IoT Edge](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-edge/how-to-install-iot-edge-linux) in your VM. (You can attach a GPU to HCI VM by following [this instruction](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure-stack/hci/manage/attach-gpu-to-linux-vm))
  - Create AKS-HCI in your HCI enviroment by following [this](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure-stack/aks-hci/overview) (VoE Kubernetes deployment is currently in Beta)

or

- **Simulated Azure IoT Edge device** (such as a PC): Set up Azure IoT Edge [instructions on Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-edge/how-to-install-iot-edge-linux) and use the amd64 tags. A test x64 deployment manifest is already available.
  - For running on CPU : A x64 ubuntu machine with docker + Azure Iot edge working
  - For running on GPU : Azure Stack Edge OR Azure/Azure Stack Hub NCv2 Ubuntu VM with Nvidia Docker + Nvidia driver + Azure Iot Edge
 
#### NOTE: This solution is only supported on Linux based Azure IoTEdge devices. Kubernetes deployment is currently in Beta and is through our [Helm Chart](#option-1-voe-helm-chart-recommended).

Vision on Edge (VoE) also uses/requires a few Azure services for its various capabilities. Some of these services will be automatically deployed for you (during VoE installation) while others may need you to pre-deploy them before installing VoE. Please follow the VoE installation paths discussed below for more information.

## Services

Check out the architecture below to see how Vision on Edge uses various services to function. Depending on your deployment target VoE will need the following Azure services as prerequisites:

- IoTEdge Devices: Azure Custom Vision + IoT Hub + Azure Video Analyzer (Recommended). Only VM deployment is supported.
- Kubernetes (AKS-HCI): Azure Custom Vision + IoT Hub

#### Get Started:

- Clone azure intelligent edge patterns branch

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-intelligent-edge-patterns.git
  ```

- Go to factoryai directory and open your vscode

  ```bash
  cd azure-intelligent-edge-patterns/factory-ai-vision
  ```

- Edit the `env-template` file, you should see something like this

  ```bash
  # For Azure Container Registry
  CONTAINER_REGISTRY_NAME=""
  CONTAINER_REGISTRY_USERNAME=""
  CONTAINER_REGISTRY_PASSWORD=""

  # For Azure IoT Hub
  IOTHUB_CONNECTION_STRING=""

  # FOR Media Services
  SUBSCRIPTION_ID=""
  RESOURCE_GROUP=""
  TENANT_ID=""
  SERVICE_NAME=""
  SERVICE_PRINCIPAL_APP_ID=""
  SERVICE_PRINCIPAL_SECRET=""
  ```

- Please fill in your credentials and rename it as `.env`, vscode will use this file to set the environment variables

- Choose a deployment template that suites your Edge device.

  - For Azure Stack Edge =>
    `deployment.ase.gpu.template.json`
  - For x86 device with CPU =>
    `deployment.cpu.template.json`
  - For x86 device with CPU =>
    `deployment.gpu.template.json`
  - using an arm64v8 device with CPU =>
    `deployment.cpu.arm64v8.template.json`
  - using an arm64v8 device with GPU =>
    `deployment.gpu.arm64v8.template.json`

  In this instruction, we take `deployment.gpu.template.json` for instance.

- Find `deployment.gpu.template.json` under `EdgeSolution` directory in vscode, right click on it, choose "Build and Push Iot Edge Solution". It'll start to build the container, you should expect to wait for more than 10 mins if it's the first time you build the container.

- Find `deployment.gpu.amd64.json` under `EdgeSolution/config` directory in vscode, right click on it, choose "Create Deployment to Single Device", select your device to deploy, you should expect the edge will pull the container for more than 10 mins if it's the first time.

- Go to your device (via ssh), use `docker ps` to check whether all the modules are pulled and running. You should see 6 modules running including:

  a. webmodule

  b. inferencemodule

  c. rtspsimmodule

  d. webdbmodule
  
  e. predictmodule
  
  f. uploadmodule

  g. azureiotedge-hub

  h. azureiotedge-agent

- Please wait until all 6 are running. Open your browser and connect [http://YOUR_DEVICE_IP:8181](http://YOUR_DEVICE_IP:8181)

## For Kubernetes (AKS/AKS-HCI/ASE K8s)(Beta)

# Troubleshooting

If you are running into issues, please check following for assistant:

1. Ensure your setup is good
   1. On CPU make sure this work: [https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/azure-iot.simulated-temperature-sensor?tab=Overview](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/azure-iot.simulated-temperature-sensor?tab=Overview)
   2. On GPU make sure this work:
      1. Quick test : run below command this will try to access nvidia gpu inside docker
         - `sudo docker run --runtime=nvidia --rm nvidia/cuda nvidia-smi`
      2. Long test :: deploy below from marketplace on your iot edge device and make sure it works
         [https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/intelligent-edge.gpureferencemodule?tab=Overview](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/intelligent-edge.gpureferencemodule?tab=Overview)
2. If this is the first time you deploy the container to your edge, you might need to wait for more than 10 mins. You can use ssh to connect to your edge and try sudo docker ps., then you should see following 2 containers running:
   YOUR_CONTAINER_REGISTRY_NAME/inferencemodule:x.x.xx-cpuamd64 (or gpu)
   YOUR_CONTAINER_REGISTRY_NAME/webmodule:x.x.xx-cpuamd64

   If you don’t see above, the containers aren't downloaded successfully yet

3. If the inference & visionweb modules exist but still cannot see the page in 8181 port, check whether 8181 port on your edge is opened.
4. If you can visit the website (in 8181 port) but not see the inference result video after clicking configuration in the Part Identification page, please check whether your edge's 5000 port is opened.
