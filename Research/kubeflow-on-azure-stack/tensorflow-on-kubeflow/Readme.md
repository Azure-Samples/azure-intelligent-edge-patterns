# Tensorflow on Kubeflow on Azure Stack

This module demonstrates how to run TensorFlow jobs on Kubeflow cluster on Azure Stack.

[TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) is a popular open source machine learning framework.

# Prerequisites

Previous familiarity with the following is recommended:

- [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [TensorFlow](https://tensorflow.org/)
- [Azure](http://azure.com)
- [Kubeflow](https://github.com/kubeflow/kubeflow)

For obvious reasons, distributed training of the models is easier to see if the cluster has more than one node in its pool, and, respectively, at least that amount of the replicas for the worker conterner instances.

**IMPORTANT: for the demo, you will need to have a DockerHub account, replace `rollingstone` with your
own account name in the commands and .yamls below.**

# Installation

Please see the `Kubeflow on Azure Stack` module of this repository, or [https://www.kubeflow.org](https://www.kubeflow.org) for details of using Kubeflow and installing it on Azure or Azure Stack.

`TFJob` is a custom workload, and you should see it among the registered custom resources:

    azureuser@k8s-master-36519982-0:~$ kubectl get crd | grep tfjob
    tfjobs.kubeflow.org          2020-05-06T01:30:30Z

It is also recommended, but not necessary, to have Kubernetes Dashboard running on the cluster.


# Building Docker image for distributed mnist model for e2e test

We will run a popular scenario from Kubeflow's repository, 
[K8s Custom Resource and Operator For TensorFlow jobs](https://github.com/kubeflow/tf-operator/)

You do not have to re-build the image, you can use `kubeflow/tf-dist-mnist-test:1.0`. If you do decide to use your own image, here is how you could build it:

    $ cd tensorflow-on-kubeflow/dist-mnist-e2e-test

Login to your Docker account(we use account `"rollingstone"`, but you will need to substitute it for your own
in all commands and .yamls):

    $ docker login
    ... enter the credentials if needed ...

Build the image:

    $ docker build -f Dockerfile -t rollingstone/tf-dist-mnist-test:1.0 ./
    Sending build context to Docker daemon  18.94kB
    Step 1/3 : FROM tensorflow/tensorflow:1.5.0

# Running a TFJob

Create a tf_job_mnist-e2e-test.yaml file, it should look like the one we provided:


    $ cat tf_job_mnist-e2e-test.yaml
    apiVersion: "kubeflow.org/v1"
    kind: "TFJob"
    metadata:
      name: "dist-mnist-for-e2e-test-demo"
    spec:
      tfReplicaSpecs:
        PS:
          replicas: 1
          restartPolicy: OnFailure
          template:
            spec:
              containers:
                - name: tensorflow
                  image: rollingstone/tf-dist-mnist-test:1.0
        Worker:
          replicas: 3
          restartPolicy: OnFailure
          template:
            spec:
            containers:
              - name: tensorflow
                image: rollingstone/tf-dist-mnist-test:1.0

To run a TFJob:

    $ kubectl create -f tf_job_mnist-e2e-test.yaml

You should see the pods being initialized:

    $ kubectl get pods
    NAME                                     READY   STATUS              RESTARTS   AGE
    ...
    dist-mnist-for-e2e-test-demo-ps-0        0/1     ContainerCreating   0          23s
    dist-mnist-for-e2e-test-demo-worker-0    0/1     ContainerCreating   0          23s
    dist-mnist-for-e2e-test-demo-worker-1    0/1     ContainerCreating   0          23s
    dist-mnist-for-e2e-test-demo-worker-2    0/1     ContainerCreating   0          23s

Then pods will be running, and, finally, getting to status `Completed`:

    $ kubeclt get pods
    NAME                                    READY   STATUS             RESTARTS   AGE
    ...
    dist-mnist-for-e2e-test-demo-worker-0     0/1     Completed          0          9m21s
    dist-mnist-for-e2e-test-demo-worker-1     0/1     Completed          0          9m21s
    dist-mnist-for-e2e-test-demo-worker-2     0/1     Completed          0          9m21s

Here is an example of the log on a worker node:

    $ kubectl logs dist-mnist-for-e2e-test-demo-worker-0

What is worth pointing out is that the nodes are being assigned individual indices:

# Persistence for models and data

If you would like to save the results of model training, you can do so from you scripts
using the Kubernetes volumes you mount. However, on Azure Stack you do not have `azurefile`
available yet, but there are many other options, e.g. you can use a network storage.

Please follow [Installing Storage](../installing_storage.md) to create `samba-share-claim` we
will be using in our .yaml files. Talk to your Azure Stack administrator to discuss other
available options in your team.

If everything is done correctly, you should be able to see the sc, pvc, and pv on your cluster,
and the common location on your nodes(`/mnt/shares/kfbuffer` in this tutorial).

    $ kubectl get pvc
    NAME                STATUS   VOLUME               CAPACITY   ACCESS MODES   STORAGECLASS    AGE
    samba-share-claim   Bound    samba-share-volume   20Gi       RWX            local-storage   2m24s

    $ kubectl get pv
    NAME                                       CAPACITY   ACCESS MODES   RECLAIM POLICY   STATUS   CLAIM                                   STORAGECLASS    REASON   AGE
    ...
    samba-share-volume                         20Gi       RWX            Retain           Bound    default/samba-share-claim               local-storage            2m41s
    ...

Now, from your script in the container you can write to that folder your serialized models during the intermediate
steps. It is better to let the master node (with rank 0) to do the logging and serialization. And the master node
should do the deserialization if needed.

Your updated .yaml should look something like:

    $ cat tf_job_mnist-e2e-test-with_persistence.yaml
    apiVersion: "kubeflow.org/v1"
    kind: "TFJob"
    metadata:
      name: "dist-mnist-for-e2e-test-demo"
    spec:
      tfReplicaSpecs:
        PS:
          replicas: 1
          restartPolicy: OnFailure
          template:
            spec:
              containers:
              - name: tensorflow
                image: kubeflow/tf-dist-mnist-test:1.0
                volumeMounts:
                - mountPath: "/tmp/mnist-data"
                  name: samba-share-volume2
              volumes:
              - name: samba-share-volume2
                persistentVolumeClaim:
                  claimName: samba-share-claim
        Worker:
          replicas: 3
          restartPolicy: OnFailure
          template:
            spec:
              containers:
              - name: tensorflow
                image: kubeflow/tf-dist-mnist-test:1.0
                volumeMounts:
                - mountPath: "/tmp/mnist-data"
                  name: samba-share-volume2
              volumes:
              - name: samba-share-volume2
                persistentVolumeClaim:
                  claimName: samba-share-claim

For our example, we save the `checkpoint`, model metadata and other information at our shared volume,
a typical run would be:

    $ kubectl create -f tf_job_mnist-e2e-test-with_persistence.yaml

And soon after, you should see the serialized model in your folder:

    $ ls /mnt/shares/kfbuffer/
    checkpoint                                                             model.ckpt-0.meta
    events.out.tfevents.1592351909.dist-mnist-for-e2e-test-demo2-worker-0  t10k-images-idx3-ubyte.gz
    graph.pbtxt                                                            t10k-labels-idx1-ubyte.gz
    model.ckpt-0.data-00000-of-00001                                       train-images-idx3-ubyte.gz
    model.ckpt-0.index                                                     train-labels-idx1-ubyte.gz

For more tutorials and How-Tos, see TensorFlow's [save_and_load.ipynb](https://github.com/tensorflow/docs/blob/master/site/en/tutorials/distribute/save_and_load.ipynb) example notebook.

## Tensorboard

There is another useful tool to monitor some ML applications if they support it. We provided a sample file to start it in your Kubernetes cluster, `tensorboard.yaml`.

A concrete example of a tensorboard-using script is in folder `tf-mnist-w-tb`. You will need your
github account to build the image(substitute `rollingstone` for yours) and run:

    $ cd mnist-w-tb
    $ docker build -t rollingstone/tf-mnist-w-tb:latest .
    $ docker push rollingstone/tf-mnist-w-tb:latest
    $ kubectl create -f tb_tf.yaml
    $ kubectl create -f tfjob.yaml

You might contact your cloud administrator to help you establish network access, or you can
use ssh port forwarding to see it via your desktop's `localhost` address and port 6006.
This is how it looks like(run it on the machine where your web browser is):

     $ ssh -NfL 6006:localhost:6006 -i id_rsa_for_kubernetes azureuser@<public_ip_address_or_dns_name>

An alternative would be to create an RDP and XWindows server at the master node and RDP to it.
If you did the ssh port fowarding, you do not need it.

Now you can access the port you forward from your Kubernetes environment:

    $ export PODNAME=$(kubectl get pod -l app=tensorboard -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}')
    $ kubectl port-forward ${PODNAME} 6006:6006

It will look something like this:

![../pics/tensorboard_graph.png](../pics/tensorboard_graph.png)

Another tab shows the input images (train/test):

![../pics/tensorboard_images.png](../pics/tensorboard_images.png)

There are scalars the model logged:

![../pics/tensorboard_scalars.png](../pics/tensorboard_scalars.png)

And histograms for different parameters:

![../pics/tensorboard_histograms.png](../pics/tensorboard_histograms.png)

There is a projector that animates the points in the NN layer dimensions:

![../pics/tensorboard_projector.png](../pics/tensorboard_projector.png)


## Next Steps

Proceed to [PyTorch on Kubeflow Tutorial](../pytorch-on-kubeflow/Readme.md) tutorial to learn how to run `PyTorchJob`s.
