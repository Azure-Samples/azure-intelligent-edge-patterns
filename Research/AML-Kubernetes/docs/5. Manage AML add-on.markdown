To use CMAKS compute target, we will install AML add-on to your AKS cluster.This process is automaically when you first attach AKS cluster to AML workspace.

The AML add-on is backend services running on customer managed cluster which bring AKS cluster to AML to handle ML workload. It includes following functions:
1.	provide security bi-direction communication channel to get training jobs from AML, and also will submit artifacts of the training jobs, such as the models, metrics and snapshot of the training jobs.
2.	ML frame operator to handle the real ML training workload, such as tf-operator, Pytorch operator and MPI operator.
3.	Job converter, convert AML job spec to underline operator spec
4.	Metrics reporter, we will collect some perf counter of run level and compute level and store the metrics to AML workspace.


The detail components of AML add-on：

By default, the AML add-on will automatically install when you attach one AKS cluster first time. In the private preview, we only support upgrade / uninstall manually. 

## Install/upgrade/uninstall manaully
### Prerequisite
to install AML operator, you need:
1. you need get the kubeconf from AKS CLI
2. you need use the AKS cluster as kubeclt current context

### Install/Upgrade(linux)
we provide a shell script to support one step installation. It is valiated in linux.
1. download [tools package](https://github.com/Azure/AML-Kubernetes/raw/master/files/tools.zip).
2. extract tools script
```
tar xvf tools.tar
```
3. go to the installer script document
```
cd installer
```
4. To update or install components in your cluster.
	- Change the content in installer/install-job-chart/values.yaml, replace sub, resource etc with actual values.
	- Run the following command, replace the ```${agent-installer-image}``` with the installer's latest image.
    ```bash install.sh ${agent-installer-image} azureml```


installer image: the install image, the newest image is: `mcr.microsoft.com/azureml/cmk8s/agent-setup:default-queue-0806-new`

compute target resource id: the resource id of this compute in Azure. It is structure is: `AML workspace resource id`/computes/`compute name`, due to in this time the compute target is not created yet, you need align to use the same compute target name in  [attach CMAKS compute](https://github.com/Azure/CMK8s-Samples/blob/master/docs/2.%20Attach%20CMAKS%20compute.markdown)

You can find the AML workspace resource id from ```AML workspace > settings > properties```.

node pool: the AKS node pool in this AKS cluster used to attach the compute target.

appinsight InstrumentationKey: the Connection String of this appinsight, you can find this from AML work space application insights.

### Verify AML add-on installation

You have several methods to validate the AML agent installation

if the `cmaks-init-job` is compeled, the AML agent installation is finished.

1. view init job status via kubectl

```
kubectl get job
```

2. view controller status in UI

### Uninstall AML add-on mannually(linux)

Use the AKS cluster as kubeclt current context.

Follow the steps 1-2 in the install process and go to the uninstaller script document.

To delete all the components installed by the agents, run the following command, replace the cluster name with your cluster name.

```bash ./uninstall.sh ${cluster_name} azureml```

## Enable metrics monitoring

CMAKS use application insights of AML worksapce to show the metrics of compute level and run level. To enable this function, you need enable custom metrics in ```appinsights>config>usage & estimated cost> custom metrics```.

![ennable custom metrics](/pics/2.7ennablecustommetrics.png)


After AML agnet is sucessful installed, you can [attach CMAKS compute](https://github.com/Azure/CMK8s-Samples/blob/master/docs/2.%20Attach%20CMAKS%20compute.markdown)
