## Using CMAKS Compute in AML sample notebooks

In this tutorial, we will give a list of AML jobs that CMAKS supported by now.
All of the supported notebooks in [AML notebooks](https://github.com/Azure/MachineLearningNotebooks) has been modified to use CMAKS compute and included in this repo under [sample_notebooks](https://github.com/Azure/AML-Kubernetes/tree/master/sample_notebooks). 
You can try these notebooks according to your scenarios.

### Not supported AML job

- ParallelRunStep: CMAKS didn't support batch inference using ParallelRunStep yet. 
    - parallel-run
    - pipeline-parallel-run
- distributed job 
    - distributed-cntk-with-custom-docker
    - distributed-chainer
    - distributed-tensorflow-with-horovod
    - distributed-pytorch-with-nccl-gloo
    - reinforcement-learning-atari-on-distributed-compute
- Automated hyperparameter tuning is only supported for types AmlCompute, DsvmCompute, RemoteCompute, ComputeInstance and str.
