    "- Docker image size ~ 800 Mb\n",
    "- Hosting image on Azure Container Registry (ACR) means each time we compile the image, we will send it, push it to cloud and then pull all the way back to edge device. In case of low Internet connection bandwidth, this may be an issue or time consuming operation.\n",
    "- There is an option where you can send smaller size DockerFile and dependencies to ACR and compile there. But in this case, 1) again you need to pull back the 1-2 GB size image to edge device 2) Even in case of a small code change in the last layers of the docker image, ACR will re-compile every layer from scratc which may take additional ~40 minutes...\n",
