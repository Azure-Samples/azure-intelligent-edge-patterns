    "## Deploy Azure ML Models to IoT Edge Devices - Using Python SDK\n",
    "You can use the Azure Machine Learning Python SDK to deploy models to IoT Edge devices if your IoT Hub is in the same subscription as your Azure ML Workspace. Otherwise, you will need to deploy using the Azure IoT CLI or the Azure Portal. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisites\n",
    "* An IoT Edge Device (specifically, the Data Box Edge machine with Compute VM enabled)\n",
    "    * Follow [steps 1 - 5a](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databox-online/data-box-edge-deploy-prep) to set up your Data Box Edge machine and enable the Linux Compute VM and an associated IoT Hub. This IoT Hub will deploy the AccelContainerImage to the Compute VM. **Note:** In order to use the Azure ML SDK to deploy your model to your IoT Hub, you must create your Data Box Edge resource in the same subscription as your Azure ML Workspace.\n",
    "* An Azure ML model registered OR a ContainerImage successfully created in your Workspace.\n",
    "    * For an Accelerated model, you can follow [this notebook](https://github.com/Azure/MachineLearningNotebooks/blob/master/how-to-use-azureml/deployment/accelerated-models/accelerated-models-quickstart.ipynb) through step 3. Step 4 and Step 5 are optional, and will be completed behind the scenes in deployment if not done.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps\n",
    "1. Retrieve your Azure ML Workspace \n",
    "* Retrieve your IoT Hub's connection string\n",
    "* Attach your IoT Hub as Azure ML Compute\n",
    "* Configure Azure ML module\n",
    "* Configure Sample Client module\n",
    "* Deploy your Model or Image\n",
    "* Stop Sample Client"
